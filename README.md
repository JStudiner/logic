# A Game to help kids learn the fundamentals of coding!

This project is a simple game that involves getting a rocket through an asteroid
belt to safely land on Earth. This was built mostly with React Js and CSS.

## How To Play

Click on one of the arrows next to the puzzle piece and click on one of the
slots above. When you press go the rocket will move in the order of the arrows.
If you send the rocket into an asteroid you will need to restart. Pressing Reset
allows you to change the arrow commands and order.

### Future updates

I plan to work on this a bit more to randomize the asteroid placement while
ensuring a path still remains. Also features to do loops with the arrows are in
development.
